🎨 Classic Red Etch-a-Sketch
An interactive, browser-based drawing board inspired by the classic mechanical drawing toy. This project demonstrates dynamic grid generation, event-driven programming, and custom CSS layouts.

🎮 How to Use
Set the Resolution: Use the control panel to choose your grid size (e.g., 16x16).

Draw: Hover your mouse over the "screen" to leave a trail.

Clear & Reset: Use the white knobs (buttons) to clear your canvas and start over.

🚀 Features
Nostalgic UI: A custom-styled "Toy Red" frame with circular knobs for a realistic feel.

Dynamic Grid: JavaScript logic that calculates and generates a perfectly centered grid regardless of the number of squares.

Clean Layout: Utilizes Flexbox with auto-margins to keep controls organized and the UI intuitive.

Optimized Performance: Uses efficient DOM manipulation to handle large grids (up to 100x100) without lag.

🛠 Tech Stack
HTML5: Semantic structure including a "main-frame" container for the toy aesthetic.

CSS3: Custom Flexbox layouts, circular button styling, and hover states.

JavaScript (ES6): Used for loops to generate the grid, event listeners for drawing, and calculating flex-basis for square sizing.

🧠 What I Learned
This project was a deep dive into the relationship between JS and CSS. I mastered:

The Power of Flexbox: Learning how to use margin-left: auto to perfectly space items in the control panel.

Dynamic Styling: Using JS to inject styles and classes into the DOM on the fly.

Refactoring: Renaming files (like index.html) and managing branches to ensure a smooth deployment on GitHub Pages.
